postgres database for open service same as mongoDB
prisma works for relational db
npx prisma init to initialize prisma files
ORM- object relational mapper 
prisma is ORM as we store data in table form but have to convert in json in object so orm is used to convert object to table
prisma db pull extracts all the tables schema from existing databases
npx prisma generate to create prisma client 
npx prisma migrate dev to create tables in database

schemas----> use models in models
models-----> use client in prisma

relationship between-
user (id, email, name) and profile (username, id, userID (FK to user.id)) is one to one 
user and post (id, title, userID (FK to user.id)) is one to many 
post and tag (id, name) is many to many (there are no FKs in many to many relationships so we make a seperate table for ids of posts and tags)
tags to post (tagID, postID)
